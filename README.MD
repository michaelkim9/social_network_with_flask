# Social Network With Flask

I am going to use Flask, Peewee, and Python itself, and build a small social network. We'll have user registration, user authentication, strongly hashed passwords, form validation, and more.

This isn't going to be Twitter or Facebook scale of course. But it'll show all sorts of things that social networks require such as user registration, sign ups, and user authentication, or log ins, cryptographically hashing passwords with a super strong decrypt library, and we'll add in the ability to follow and unfollow people so you can see status updates. 

To run this application, please run the following command in bash:

```bash
$ python app.py
```
